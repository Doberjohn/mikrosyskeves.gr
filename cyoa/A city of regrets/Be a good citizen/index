You hustle through the crowd, trying to stay under the shop canopies to avoid the rainstorm.

“It’s a really shitty day, even for Albuquerque,” you think. A huge video wall of a nearby
metropolitan skyscraper reads, “Be a good citizen. Respect the new order.”

After a while, the green-yellow neon sign of a motel, La Hacienda, welcomes you home.
A noise coming from the back alley catches your attention. It’s a man crying for help!

You circle the building, to find two cops brutally beating a man in an expensive suit.
His plea for help echoes in your head.

1. Ask the cops to leave the man alone. This isn’t what you signed up for.
2. Activate your blades and attack the cops. You feel like slicing them open in style.
3. Let them keep beating the rich guy. He probably deserves it.
4. Scan the cops for cybernetics and try to hack them.
5. Distract the cops and try to save the guy.
